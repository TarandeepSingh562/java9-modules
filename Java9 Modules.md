# N things every Java developer should know about Java 9th's Module System

(this post is part of our mini Java 9 series - check out other posts!)

[Jigsaw](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/) is a huge project started at sun way back in August 2008. Delayed due to technical and non-technical reasons (eg. integrating Sun into Oracle) it's finally there to make Java modular. Encompassing 6 JEPs, it will be a part of Java 9 release which is going to happen in about 100 days. Let's take a peek at what it brings:

## 0. Modules? What are we talking about?

If this is your first post about Jigsaw, you may be unaware of the concept of modularity. In general modularity refers to 

## 1. Writing modular code
For me, the easiest way to learn something is to see it in action... (I jedziesz z modułami na początek)

## 2. Breaking The Monolith

- what structure has java right now? 
- what structure will it have after splitting
- lack of clarity on dependencies
- public is too open


## 2. Tailor-made runtime (size)
(show how to use jlink to create your own runtime)
- large jars, large rt.jar


(show module creation etc)

## 4. Increased security and performance
(try to invoke code on your java app)

## 5. Jar hell solutions
Do i want to talk about it??

## 6. Caveats??
 - show how to check if apis are inaccessible?
 - how to find out if i'm ready for migration?
